Setup so far..

The proventia scanner needs to be connected to stimulate the attacks on the system.


The provenance code :


IBM Proventia Scanner
IBM Proventia Network Scanner

1) Requires information about the entire network config.
     Perspective scan allows you to identify scanners in the network and then configure your scans(cycle, duration,etc)
2) We define the logical location of components on the network and we select the perspective
3) OS identification to scan: It uses the information provided by the user or imported from the directory to scan
A     gent will match the OSID to a valid operating system.
4) Vulneability management: provides statistics of vulnerabilities (priority and time based)
     Can sort by IP, priority, object affected and most recent
     Vulnerability description provided as well.
5) The SiteProtector Console groups all the reports
6) Enterprise Scanner maintains log files for diagnosing problems with the agent (Details of all scanning and operational processes on the agent)
     Refresh procedure limits the log file size (if it touches 50MB, the current log gets backed up and new is generated)
     Log access: Status> Logs
     getFullLogs (fulllogs.tz)
7) Alert log stored as well. can filter to find details
8) Ticketing is a system to keep track of a situation that requires further investigation (eg. Patching, investigate an asset on the network)


Proposal for Independent Study
Proposal for the Independent Study:
Topic Title:  Trust and Security of Virtualized Systems
Instructor Name: Dr Mladen Vouk
Student Name: Neelesh Srinivas Salian                                  
Student ID # 001082220
Dear Dr Vouk, Dr Reeves,
I write this letter to put forth my request to pursue an Independent Study in the Fall 2013 Semester. This independent study will be done under the guidance of Dr Mladen Vouk and the details of the study are provided below.
The main aspect of this independent study is a report that is related to my thesis of the same title. It is a detailed report of the working of the project.
Content:
The report will elaborate the structure, implementation and the results obtained in the experiment.
The project is a combination of 4 individual projects that are based on the VCL system; Micro Cloud, Provenance Engine, Policy Engine and Security/ Forensics.
The idea is to setup a test infrastructure using the Micro Cloud project that will serve as the system(s) to carry the experiment on.
The idea is to look into the policy compliance and the statistics of the systems that lead to assuring trust upon the system. The system must be operational and should possess the ability to not only detect the anomaly but also record it. This record should be easily available on the request of the admin. So, the controller (parent) machine should be able to tell whether the child machine is under attack or has been comprised or not.
E.g. the violations occurred in the last 5 hours could be a query.  So, to satisfy that, the system must store all the data about its operations in one location or more (depends on the system). The system should be able to produce a statistical representation of the query to the user that gives an idea of the violations in the last 5 hours (if any).
The Controller (parent machine) will be the center of this system. It will hold the provenance, policy and security module in order to obtain data and track the child systems on its network.
The ultimate goal is to assure trust in the system using these modules. The more secure and policy complaint the system will be, the more trustworthy it is to the user.
Estimated Completion Time:
The report should be completed towards the end of the Fall 2013 semester.This is the intended Independent study work layout.
I request your approval of this proposal.
